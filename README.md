# Simple-Neural-Network
This is the code of a single hidden layer vanilla neural network implemented completely from scratch, without using any kind of neural network/machine learning library.
It is trained with coordinates of points on a 2D plane. Given an input point, it outputs which quadrant that point is situated in.
